<p>
    This is a project page template based on bootstrap 4.1 and jQuery for github projects.

<p>
    One of its main feature is to have all the parts of the webpages separated and saved in different template and data files. The benefit it provides is to change some part of a page for example a header, one dont have to update it on every page, it is just updated in its template file and the loading jQuery will manege it for final website
