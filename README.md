<h2>A simple yet dynamic project page template for github projects</h2>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>This is a project page template based on bootstrap 4.1 and jQuery for github projects.</p>
<br/>
<p>One of its main feature is to separate the template part and page content part. The benefit it provides is to change some part of a page for example a header, one don't have to update it on every page, it is just updated in its template file and the loading jQuery will manege it for final website</p>
